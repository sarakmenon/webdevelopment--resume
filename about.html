<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kunju Menon. I am a computer science student attending the University of Texas at Dallas as a Eugene McDermott Scholar 
  and as a National Merit Scholar. I am currently a senator for student government working on the communications committee. 
  Through student government, I not only am in charge of helping to run SG's Instagram page, but I also work to create flyers and visuals
  to help spread information about various issues or events happening around campus. In addition, I am part of a Humanoid, Biorobotics and Smart Systems 
  lab on campus. 
  And as for service, I currently volunteer at UTDâ€™s Comet Cupboard, which is essentially a food bank available to all students on campus.
